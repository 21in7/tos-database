      This is an open-source database for Tree of Savior, a game being developed by IMC Games.<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is still in active development, taking multiple updates per week, with the latest patches and new features.
      <span class="badge badge-success">Re:Build</span> patch is already supported<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, a <a [routerLink]="routerLink('simulator')">Skill Simulator</a> is available, making use of the in-game formulas to calculate skill damage, skill SP costs and attribute unlock logic.<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      A Database is also available, and currently supports the following datasets:
    </p>
    <ul *ngFor="let group of TOSDataSetService.VALUES; index as i">
      <li *ngFor="let option of group.options">
        <a [routerLink]="routerLink('database/' + TOSDataSetService.toUrl(option))">{{ TOSDataSetService.toLabel(option) }}</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
