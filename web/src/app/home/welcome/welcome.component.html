    </p>

    <p>
      It is still in active development, taking multiple updates per week, with the latest patches and new features.<br/>
      <span class="badge badge-success">Re:Build</span> patch is already supported, and currently available only on <b>kTEST</b> region, which can be changed at the top right<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, a <a [routerLink]="routerLink('simulator')">Skill Simulator</a> is available, making use of the in-game formulas to calculate skill damage, skill SP costs and attribute unlock logic.<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      A Database is also available, and currently supports the following datasets:
    </p>
    <ul *ngFor="let group of TOSDataSet.VALUES; index as i">
      <li *ngFor="let option of group.options">
        <a [routerLink]="routerLink('database/' + TOSDataSet.toUrl(option))">{{ TOSDataSet.toLabel(option) }}</a>
