            <p> * The Shadow Master's Experiment Journal Part 1<br/>{np} Ubik took a deep breath and turned around.<br/>She saw, in the seats provided, the various mage Masters sitting side by side.<br/>Some were apathetic, while others looked on with anticipation.<br/>But regardless of how there Masters felt, Ubik did not want to fail before any of them.<br/>{np} With great composure, Ubik signaled towards her students and a monster began to take shape from the shadows.<br/>{np}  Remembering its name would be a task for another day.<br/>Ubik, knowing it would be a failure to lose focus now, carefully, but with quick precision, completed her casting.<br/>{np} The monster's pursuing shadow shot out into four arrows - arrows so sharp they hung like needles.<br/>{np} These arrows embedded themselves, one by one, into each of the monster's four feet.<br/>The monster let out a shriek as it found itself pinned to the ground.<br/>{np} The shadow crawled from the monster's feet up to its legs threading and separating into separated arrows above and below, crisscrossing around and swiftly piercing the monster's body with sixteen strikes.<br/>{np} The shadow then rose above the monster and formed into a gigantic lance and whatever breath was left was taken away with one swift strike that pierced the monster's head.<br/>{np} The demonstration complete, Shadowmancer Master Ubik turned to face the various Masters that sat on the platform behind her.<br/>The first to comment was the Sorcerer Master, Dame Circe.<br/>{np} [That shadow control is something that can only be seen at the Master's level, no? I think it would be hard for other Shadowmancers to follow. You have gathered too many Masters here to perform a feat that only one of Master level can perform.]<br/>{np} Before Ubik could respond with [That little...], Wican Celestic stepped in.<br/>{np} [Circe is correct. If it is a skill of this level that other Shadowmancer cannot follow then it is indeed nothing but magically valuable.<br/>{np} Also, seeing as how the Sorcerer Master also has a similar skill to reflect a demon's shadow, you may not be able to invoke the amount that she can summon.]<br/>{np} While Ubik thought that Wican always agrees with Circe, Winona Ende spoke up.<br/>[But Ubik is not fighting Circe, and not all sorcerer can control demons like Sorcerer Master. It is not completely useless.]<br/>{np} This time Ili Teird spoke.<br/>[You are all correct. However, let us move on to the next demonstration. If we continue to discuss after each display, one day will not be enough.]<br/>With that, Ubik turned back around and motioned again to her students, who released a second monster.<br/>{np} This time without appearing to move, Ubik pinned the monster to the ground.<br/>And this time Thaumaturge Master Larisa was first to gave her opinion.<br/>{np} [Isn't this the normal skill of a Shadowmancer? To pin down an opponent's shadow so that is unable to move? It's a skill that they all know.]<br/>[Correct,] Ubik answered and signaled.<br/>{np} Her students began to turn on and off the magic flames that were prepared on all sides. Even during the day the flames were strong and more shadows of the monster appeared. But that was not all.<br/>{np} The monster began to be yanked around by the shadows that had just newly formed.<br/>And as it was restrained to its shadow, if the shadow suddenly appeared in another location or drastically changed shape or direction, the body too was forcefully moved to follow suit.<br/>{np} Each time the monster hit the ground it received physical damage.<br/>The monster was then dragged into the air and slammed into the hard ground multiple times until the monster was no more.<br/>Ubik turned around again to face the other Master's criticisms.{np} This time again Sorcerer Master Circe was the first to speak.<br/>[To fight like this, isn't it a problem to have to prepare lighting every time?]<br/>{np} Linker Master Winona Ende Spoke afterward.<br/>[I can use linking technology well, and I can do it without preliminaries if I instantly place a glowing object like a fireball or something of magic every side.<br/>{np} This is a technical application for a joint battle with other mages. This might be the original intention.]<br/>Ubik liked that Winona mentioned linkage attacks.<br/>But that did not last long as Psychokino Ili Terid soon said:<br/>{np} [But if you're going to give the enemy a physical shock like that, why don't you just do this?]<br/>After saying so, Ili Terid grabbed, with his telekinesis power, the body of the monster that was already dead and he waved it back and forth.<br/>Wican Celestic intervened without hesitation.<br/>{np} [Of course if there are times where I cannot get the help of Telekinesis or Psychokino, that would be the situation when I would need this. But it doesn't seem very efficient.]<br/>Sorcerer Master Circe rose from her sit and spoke,<br/>{np} [I understand that the Shadowmancer Master has taken Shadowmancer magic to a higher level. But I don't feel as though the other mage Masters necessarily needed to see it. I would like to see more, but sadly I'm too busy. This is all I will watch for today.]<br/>{np} With that, Dame Circe along with Wican Celestic said their goodbyes.<br/>The other mage Masters, some of which were interested in the demonstration and wanted to stay, were divided on what to do next.<br/>{np} At the time, the quiet Chronomancer Master Lucid Winterspoon rose from her chair.<br/>As she was their elder, the other Masters as well stood up and began to say their goodbyes to Ubik.<br/>{np} Although the first to stand, Lucid Winterspoon was the last to approach.<br/>[It seems that my action has caused a  reaction through the others, but that was not my true intention.]<br/>Ubik heard this and spoke,<br/>{np} [Was that not what you had intended when you rose from your seat?]<br/>[Yes, there was that. But that was not all. I wanted to speak with you alone.]<br/>Ubik was both excited and worried about what this living legend of magic has to say.<br/>{np} Lucid Winterspoon said,<br/>[As a result, of magic you just demonstrated, you were able to send the body of the tied down shadow to another place. If you develop this further you would be able to apply this to teleportation. Have you thought of that?]<br/>{np} [But to do that, I will have to solve the problem of physical shock upon arrival. The further the distance the stronger the shock. So of course, you could send the monster a shorter distance and they will not be damaged. But it depends.]<br/>{np} Lucid Winterspoon grinned at hearing those words and said,<br/>[If that was the only problem, then in comparison it would be easily solvable.]<br/>Ubik thought for a moment and replied,<br/>{np} [Plus, another problem is, if you want to send the shadow further, one will need stronger lighting as well. And lights need to be installed the further the location. Plus if the body isn't there, there is no way to send the shadow of that body first.]<br/>{np} [Then what if you do not use your own shadow. What if you used the shadow of something else?]<br/>{np} [I've never considered that so I'm not sure if it is possible. I would have to come to that conclusion through research, no? To send my shadow or to send the shadow of someone else, the problem is still the same as the one before.<br/>{np} Without a way to call on stronger lights and the shadow first, the body will still need to go to the place to reach the shadows.]<br/>Lucid Winterspoon grinned again and said,<br/>{np} [And if that shadow was the moon's?]<br/>At those words, Ubik's expression changed.<br/>[That's genius! If you can utilize the shadow of the solar or lunar eclipse then one can call upon it from anywhere. I hadn't thought of that.]{np} Lucid Winterspoon spoke again.<br/>[Well, try. Teleportation has been considered inefficient but until trying, you won't know. How would you feel about researching this type of magic? I will be able to help you from time to time.]<br/>{np} [Yes, why not? I will start from today. Thank you so much. This is an amazing idea, Master Lucid.]<br/>And from that day forward, the Shadowmancer Master was known as Eclipse Ubik.</p>
