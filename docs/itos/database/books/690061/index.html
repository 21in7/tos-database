            <p>{np}<br/><br/>{@ST43}Andale Village Resident Diary{/}{np}<br/>-The 4th of X <br/> - <br/> There's been very little traffic coming to town from the capital. <br/> When one family moved in, the whole village threw a welcome party. <br/> After all, how many outsiders do we get to meet these days? <br/>{np}I might not know for what reason people would come all the way out here, <br/> but after Medzio Diena, it feels great to be in such a cheerful town. <br/> I might skip work tomorrow and party along. <br/> <br/>{np}The 5th of X<br/>-<br/>I steamed some potato dumplings to try to get to know the new neighbors.<br/>I heard some loud noises when I knocked on the door.<br/>The neighbor seemed to be quite expressionless, but lightened up at the sight of the dumplings I had brought along.<br/>{np}He apologized for his lack of spirit before, as he and his son were putting up wallpaper. <br/> What a harmonious family, I wonder if I could create something like that?{np}The 10th of X <br/> - <br/> Mr. Raman, who lived at the bank of the creek opposite from us, went on leave. His wife said he was off to get firewood. <br/> Well, for a long time he was gone in Klaipeda. <br/>I've heard that you can find a lot of beautiful girls in Klaipeda. <br/>{np}The 13th of X <br/> - <br/>Today was prayer day, but somehow everyone in town had a stomach ache, so we could not celebrate. Why this happened specifically on this day I do not know. <br/>Well, illnesses will be illnesses. I guess we'll just eat some potato porridge to feel better. <br/>{np}The 14th of X <br/> - <br/> Last night I had an argument with my little sister. <br/>Writing down what you really think isn't that embarrassing. After what happened, <br/>I made a necklace as a present to her, and she came back to me. <br/>Well, I had to give in eventually. Even so, on one morning, she disappeared to somewhere. <br/>{np}Ah, just now my neighbor made me some delicious porridge. <br/> In return I made them some warm soup. I can cook too, you know? <br/>Tonight will be another feast so I'm going to make sure to eat and drink plenty.{np}The 16th of X <br/> - <br/> I got a stomachache drinking soup that I didn't know already went bad. <br/> I double-checked the smell before eating it, but there was no bad odor. <br/>I felt horrible inside so I went to the well for water. Even with the water, I continued to feel horrible. <br/>{np}I've been throwing up a lot lately but it seems to be getting better now. <br/>Tomorrow I'm going to go see Mr. Gordon to get some medicinal herbs. <br/> My little sister still hasn't come back yet. When I go to her room, I find no clothes. Even Mr. Raman is getting worried.{np}The 17th of X <br/> - <br/> The village was eerily quiet today. <br/>There are no signs of the people who went earlier to get herbs from Mr. Gordon.<br/><br/>The 23rd of X <br/> - <br/> This might be the last time I get to write in this diary. <br/> Lyliana, you are the only family I have left in this world... <br/> Please be alive somewhere... <br/>{np}<br/>(There is something written, but it's all jumbled up and has ceased to be legible.){np}Unknown Date <br/> - <br/>Several days must've passed. <br/>I've been on the run for around two days now without food or sleep. <br/>The people who fled to Klaipeda were all caught and killed. <br/>I don't even know how many are still alive and can walk. <br/>Everything is as quiet as the shadows, yet moving at a quick pace. We are all tense from fear of attack.{np}They did not wish for any uproar or disorder. <br/>They are not people. <br/>We must somehow notify Klaipeda. <br/>A last resort would be to abandon everything we can't use and move out.</p>
