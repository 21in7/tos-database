            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>If we were to use force, we should have done it before the tower was complete, was Solcomm's conclusion. Even so, Solcomm had no other choice but to resort to an all-out attack. He couldn't just ignore the criticisms from his superiors, so he had to push on. Also, he had to try at least once.{np}While being very much aware that Schaffenstar will not lower their defenses, Solcomm kept his force from making hasty attacks, and gathered even more demons by pushing Pbeta.<br/>After Solcomm's failures were spread in the demonic world, Pbeta's job of recruiting demons became much more difficult, and she made sure to let Solcomm know of her difficulties.<br/>However, Solcomm was ready to push himself to  the end for the last time.{np}For more than six months, Solcomm prepared for his all-out attack. He didn't have enough flying demons, nor enough ships, but he had to make do by approaching the tower through the lake. {np}The magical levitation stones were floating in a way that shallow water still flowed over them. It was too shallow for boats, and still too deep for demons to cross.<br/>Lydia Schaffen made sure these stones were floating at the exact heights to make this possible. This also made Schaffenstar members' shoes wet all the time, but for demons, it was a deadly threat.{np}When there weren't any battles or training during the day, Schaffenstar's recruits removed moss and water plants from the stones with rakes.<br/>After that, they carefully walked to the edge and tossed the plants in the lake.<br/>These tossed plants eventually became food for creatures living in the lake, leading countless creatures to be gathered around the floating stones.{np}Schaffenstar recruits were strictly trained and taught where the edges were, and where it was safe to walk, because there was no end to the lake's depth.<br/>Their daily routine of removing plants was also helpful in drilling this information into their minds. Of course, seniors were always nearby to make sure absolutely no recruits accidently fell in the lake.{np}Such accidents were much more fatal than one would think.<br/>As mentioned before, creatures were always gathered around the edges of these stones.<br/>These creatures may seem harmless from above, but if someone were to fall over the edge, they would attack that person without any hesitation. A fall into the lake was almost impossible to survive.<br/>This was one of the biggest reasons that made attacking the tower from the lake very difficult.<br/>If the boats were to sink, the demons didn't have anywhere to swim to.<br/>Although they were strong enough to swim to the edges of these stones, those were the most dangerous places.{np}The parts of the lake that didn't have any magical levitation stones over them were much safer.<br/>Of course, this would only be true until the demons become exhausted from swimming and sunk below.<br/>However, the villagers under protection of Schaffenstar were mostly safe in these areas. You see, the plants that were fed to them weren't intended to be food, but rather, highly addictive substances.<br/>This was one of Lydia's defensive strategies.{np}Because of their addiction, most of the aggressive and carnivorous creatures stayed around these edges, and other fish could safely breed and grow their numbers. This hugely benefited the fishermen of the village.<br/>Although carnivorous creatures would sometimes return to the lake's center to find their prey, they would immediately return to the edges for more plants afterward.<br/>The fishermen ran into these creatures occasionally, but they always carried some dried water plants to toss in the water.{np}However, tossing these plants in the wrong places could lead to fatal accidents, so the Schaffenstar members warned the fishermen to do this only when necessary.<br/>In the end, since most of these plants were tossed near the edges, the most dangerous creatures just stayed there rather than chasing the fishermen.{np}All of these factors guaranteed that the walkable surfaces were kept clean.<br/>These clean surfaces were soon tainted by Solcomm and his minions during their march toward the Astral Tower.{np}They brought vast amounts of soil to pour over the stones, which made it safe for the demons to march.<br/>It is a textbook tactic to fill moats that surround castles, but in this case, the whole lake functioned as one giant moat. A siege that involved filling a whole lake like this was unprecedented.<br/>Thankfully for the demons, the water was shallow enough where they were, but they still had a long way to go.<br/>Also, they had to cover a wide surface to avoid incoming arrows from the tower.{np}Despite their fierce march, a whole day has passed without a single battle.<br/>This was peculiar, but expected at the same time. The demons were busy filling the lake to make paths, and they kept out of Astral Tower's catapult's reach.<br/>Even Lydia Schaffen was limited by her weapons' range.{np}Because the area above the magical levitation stones were actually safe from the Astral Tower's defensive weapons,<br/>all Schaffenstar had to do was place guards on the tower and observe their slow progress. The typical process of pouring arrows upon attackers' siege attempts wasn't going to happen for a while.{np}On the second day, it finally happened.<br/>Solcomm's army finally reached the tower's attack range.<br/>Right after this, Schaffenstar members fired all sorts of projectiles above demons' heads, which reached much further than what humans' weapons are normally capable of. While the projectiles were flying over them, the demons had no choice but to keep filling the lake.{np}Siege towers with roofs were brought to minimize the damage, but even such structures would fall to the continuous stream of projectiles.<br/>One positive outcome from all this was that the thrown rocks could be utilized to fill more parts of the lake.<br/>Because the Astral Tower was built on top of a lake, most traditional siege weapons were rendered useless.<br/>For example, digging tools for sieges couldn't be used, even if demons were capable of digging underwater.{np}Solcomm was indeed aware of the fact that Lydia Schaffen would be fully prepared for him.<br/>If his enemy was the lake, he was even prepared to bring an army the size of an ocean to swallow that lake. He was under that much pressure from by his superiors.{np}Unfortunately, for Solcomm, his army was progressing at an excruciatingly slow speed, and its number was becoming smaller by the minute.<br/>Most demons and monsters love to fight, and are used to desperate situations.<br/>However, this was something else. All they did was staring at their feet while being attacked. Unsurprisingly, complaints began pouring out.<br/>Dying in a proper battle was much more preferable, and they are much more controllable during battles.{np}However, Solcomm's minions quickly grew tired doing nothing against the arrows and stones that were flying toward them.<br/>Even Pbeta's discontent toward Solcomm was growing.{np}Despite all this, his army finally reached the tower's entrance.<br/>Flying demons, who were occupied in shooting down the projectiles, could finally focus on attacking the tower.<br/>Although some demons had to keep filling the lake, the rest could march straight over the small amount of water. Finally, after several days have passed, they would have their proper battle.{np} Of course, streams of boiling water, stones, arrows, fire, and magic started pouring over the demons' heads when they got close enough. Most of the flying demons were hit by arrows soon after the battle began, and they fell on parts of the lake that weren't filled.<br/>Although it seemed like Solcomm was fighting a losing battle, it was still a battle.{np}Solcomm was ready to fight to his death, no matter the outcome. All of his demons were already on the lake, and Solcomm himself charged in front of his minions.<br/>Despite popular belief, there is no such thing as an impregnable castle.<br/>Even if all the siege attempts had failed, the defenders are bound to run out of resources without help from allies to attack the surrounding army. Sturdy weaponry and catapults are only there to buy enough time for that to happen. Whether you were on the attacking side, or the defending side, the side who is able to hold out wins.{np}Knowing this, Solcomm kept encouraging his demons.<br/>But then, when he looked over his head, he saw Lydia Schaffen herself, aiming an arrow at his head.<br/>It almost looked as if she was waiting for Solcomm to see her aiming at him.{np}At that moment, Solcomm immediately recognized the weapon she was holding. It was the bow that killed the Demon Lord Ziburynas.<br/>A single arrow would be enough to kill Solcomm.<br/>Solcomm was well aware that she would be able to hit him with her arrow if he charged in front.<br/>Despite this, he had to do this to silence the resentment from his minions and superiors.{np}He could withstand the scolding from Gesti, but if she sent him back to Kartas, there would be no telling what he would do to Solcomm as punishment.<br/>Being tortured by Kartas was much worse than being killed by Lydia's arrows.{np}However, her arrow never came. Instead, she withdrew her arrow and said this: [Fools! You are standing over stones that are controlled with magic.]<br/>Her words could be clearly heard by Solcomm who was still quite far away.<br/>However, he did not understand the meaning behind her words. He was about to find out.{np}At that moment, the stones that Solcomm's army was standing on started trembling, and soon after, they started to sink below the lake.<br/>Even demons who generally remain calm in times of chaos started screaming.<br/>Water started pouring over the stones and burned every demon that was on them.<br/>Solcomm couldn't do anything but watch his minions burn and melt in water.<br/>It was then Solcomm finally realized that Lydia was waiting for his entire army to move on to the lake.<br/>The distance his army had to run would take days.<br/>Even his flying minions had to avoid rains of arrows to retreat.{np}When only a handful of demons made it out, Pbeta arrived with additional demons from the demonic world.<br/>Because Solcomm was too shocked to do anything, Pbeta calmed the survivors in his stead.{np}Based on the report made by Pbeta after this incident, these magical levitation stones cannot be raised or lowered easily.<br/>According to experts on magic, if the stones were moved like this once, it would take decades before being able to do so again.{np}However, at the very moment, Solcomm and Pbeta didn't have the time to think it through. All the construction done over the stones were destroyed,<br/>and Schaffenstar members took back what could be used as defensive weapons, and threw out the rest.{np}Some demons were sent to interrupt their operations, but it was too difficult to fight on the lake in the first place. Also, the guards on the tower quickly warned the cleaning crew whenever any demons got close. Half of Schaffenstar shot arrows to keep them at bay, and the other half would run to retreat, taking turns.<br/>The situation was against Solcomm from the beginning, but it didn't stop him from being shunned by demon society.<br/>Although the lower demons wouldn't dare insult him at his face, Solcomm was aware of their discontent.<br/>He couldn't, however, figure out how to regain their trust.</p>
